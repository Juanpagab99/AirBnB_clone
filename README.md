<h2 align="center">Description 📑</h2> <br>

In this project, as the first step of the AirBnB clone, a console was made that will allow you to control, manage or administer your AirBnB objects.

<h2 align="center">Command interpreter 📑</h2> <br>

It is like a shell only that it has its own specific characteristics, which are:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object
